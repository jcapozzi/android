            A farmer and his wolf, goat and cabbage come to the edge of a river
            they wish to cross. There is a boat at the river\'s edge that only the
            farmer can row. The farmer can take at most one other object besides himself
            on a crossing, but if the wolf is ever left with the goat, the wolf will eat
            the goat; similarly, if the goat is left with the cabbage, goat will eat it.
            Devise a sequence of crossings of the river so that all four characters arrive
            safely on the other side.
